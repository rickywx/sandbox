    MAKE FAMILY SCRIPTURE TIME PRODUCTIVE. GET THE KIDS EXCITED. 
    IF KIDS CAN SEE HOW THE BOOK OF MORMON APPLIES TO THEM AND IF READING THE BOOK IS FUN, 
    YOU MIGHT HEAR, "IS IT TIME TO READ YET?", RATHER THAN, "DO WE HAVE TO?" 
    WE ARE COUNSELED TO SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES, NOT JUST READ THEM. IT TAKES PREPARATION TO DO THAT WITH CHILDREN. 
    THIS IS THE PREPARATION THAT I'VE DONE. NOW I HAVE IT FOR REFERENCE NEXT TIME. AND YOU DO TOO. COMMENTS WELCOME.

<h3>Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith - Section 3 - The Gold Plates<h3>
<h4>This section starts with "I shortly after arose from my bed..." to "conducted in the last days."</h4>


Again, act out the events of the Testimony of the prophet Joseph Smith. You may want to switch roles. You'll need someone be Joseph, someone to be the angel, someone to be Joseph Smith father, Joseph Smith Sr, and 1 or more family members to narrate or read everything other than the angel's parts."

Why did Joseph collapse? Why do you think the angel wanted him to go tell his father? Would you believe your 14 year-old son or relative if he told you a story like this? Why do you think Joseph's father believed him? What do you think was written on the plates? What was a "Urim and Thumim"? What was the urim and thumim for? What was a breastplate? What was it for? Why did the angel forbid him from removing the items?

<h3>Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith - Section 2 - Sleepless Night<h3>
<h4>This section starts with "Again, he told me..." to "our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night."</h4>


Again, act out the events of the Testimony of the prophet Joseph Smith. You may want to switch roles. You'll need someone be Joseph, someone to be the angel, someone to shine a light on the angel (this is a good job for really small children - or they may enjoy just watching), and 1 or more family members to narrate or read everything other than the angel's parts."

Why do you think the Lord chose Moroni to visit Joseph Smith? Why did he visit him 3 times in one night? Have you ever stayed awake all night? Think about the last time you stayed up really late. How did you feel the next day? How do you think Joseph felt after staying up all night?

<h3>Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith - Section 1 - Visitation</h3>

Who was this visitor? What was the book he spoke of?

Act out the events of the first section of the Testimony of the prophet Joseph Smith. You'll need someone be Joseph, someone to be the angel, someone to shine a light on the angel (this is a good job for really small children - or they may enjoy just watching), and 1 or more family members to narrate or read everything other than the angel's parts (starting with "He called me by name..." to the end of the section - "that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book."

Many people say that Joseph Smith made up the stories about being visited by Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and then later by Angel Moroni. What can you do to find out for yourself if it's true? Have you done that? What happened? Challenge family members to pray to know whether this really happened.

<h3>Testimony of the Eight Witnesses</h3>
<h4>Play the Witness Game.</h4>

If we had the 3 witnesses why do we need 8 witnesses?
How were the 8 witnesses related to Joseph Smith and the early church? Why do you think these brethren were chosen as witnesses?

Here is some more details about the 8 witnesses: http://en.fairmormon.org/Book_of_Mormon/Witnesses/Eight_witnesses

<h3>The Witness Game</h3>
<h4>This is hotter / colder with a twist for older children.</h4>


The basic game for young ones:
One person is designated as the finder. She leaves the room while someone else hides an object. For little children the hiding place shouldn't be too difficult. After the object is hidden, the finder comes back in and begins to look for the hidden object. Everyone else is a 'witness'. They saw the object hidden, so  they know it's location. They are to share their witness with the finder without directly telling the finder exactly where the object is hidden (where's the fun in that?). They do this by saying, 'you're getting hotter' as the finder approaches the hidden object, or 'you're getting colder' as the finder moves away from the object until the object is found. 

The advanced game for older children:
Make the game a little more challenging for older children by allowing some of the witnesses to be 'false witnesses' who try to lead the finder away from the hidden object. The finder must learn to discern the true witnesses from the false witnesses. This can be very challenging!

Discussion
Discuss the importance of having witnesses to testify of truth. Here are some questions to help you get going:

Did the witnesses make it easier to find the object? Why? 
How hard would it be to find the object without having a witness?
Were you able to discern the true witnesses from the false witnesses? How? 
What witnesses do we have that tell us the direction we need to go and testify of truth?
What is the most important witness? (HINT: It's not the 3 witnesses or the 8 witnesses or the scriptures or your parents.) (ANSWER: The Holy Ghost. You can have him as a constant companion if you have the gift of the holy ghost, but he can still be a witness and you can feel his influence even without the gift).

<h3>Testimony of the Three Witnesses</h3>
<h4>Discussion: Why do you think the Lord allowed 3 witnesses to the gold plates? What if Joseph Smith was the only person to have claimed to have seen the gold plates?</h4>

Give each person an opportunity to describe something they know about one of the 3 witnesses, David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris. If you know very little about them, you could take a few days to learn more about them.

Before you learn about each of them, write down at least 3 questions and try to answer those questions as you read about him. Here are some ideas:

What was his profession?
What was his relationship to Joseph Smith?
Why do you think he was chosen as one of the 3 witnesses?
Did he stay with the church throughout his life? If not, why not?
Here are some online resources to find out more about these men:
